# Cloud

Let's talk about cloud and cloud services. What is a cloud? What is a cloud service?
Why do we need cloud services? How we can use cloud services?

<br />

## What is Cloud?

Simply put, the cloud is the Internet—more specifically, it's all of the things you can access remotely over the Internet. When something is in the cloud, it means it's stored on Internet servers instead of your computer's hard drive.

<br />

## What is Cloud Computing?

Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
